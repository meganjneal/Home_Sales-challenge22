# Home Sales Analysis - Challenge 22

**Student:** Megan Neal  
**Instructor:** Brandon Knox

This notebook analyzes home sales data using PySpark SQL functions. The analysis includes:

- Initializing a SparkSession
- Reading the `home_sales_revised.csv` data
- Creating a temporary table for SparkSQL queries
- Running queries to calculate the average price for:
  - 4-bedroom houses by year
  - 3 bed/3 bath houses by year
  - Houses with 3 beds, 3 baths, 2 floors, and 2000+ sqft by year
  - Homes with view ratings having average prices â‰¥ $350,000 (with runtime comparison for cached and parquet data)
- Caching and uncaching operations
- Parquet partitioning for additional analysis

## How to Run

To run the analysis:
1. Open `Home_Sales.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Ensure the CSV file (`home_sales_revised.csv`) is in the same directory or update the path in the notebook
3. Execute the cells sequentially
